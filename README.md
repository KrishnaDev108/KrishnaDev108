// I am KrishnaDev108,black belt in taekwondo and I code like Arjuna fights: with passion, precision, 
and unwavering focus. Black belt in taekwondo and algorithms, 
I'm here to conquer the mobile development realm and leave a lasting impact. Join me on this quest!

// Mobile development is my playground, where pixels dance and apps come alive. 
// But my heart finds solace in the Bhagavad Gita, where wisdom whispers and dharma guides. 
// Black belt? Just a reminder that the mind controls the body, in code and in combat.
// Scientist by day, code warrior by night, always seeking the truth in every line and every lab. 

// I'm currently:
* Building mobile worlds with Kotlin and Jetpack, smoother than a roundhouse kick.
* Decoding the algorithms of life, one data point at a time.
* Refining my inner Arjuna, seeking balance between action and peace.

// I'm looking for:
* Epic mobile projects that make a difference, like a Krishna-powered social network.
* Teams that value both innovation and mindfulness, where code is karma and bugs are conquered.
* Challenges that push my limits, both on the screen and on the mat.

// Find me at:
* Twitter: @KrishnaDev108 (tweets may contain Gita quotes and epic code snippets)
* Email: kris.dev108@email.com (open to dharma discussions and mobile dev collaborations)

// Pronouns: He/him, but open to learning yours.

// Fun fact: My taekwondo black belt doubles as a debugging tool. Bugs beware!
